1. What is time sharing in an operating system?
	
	Time sharing refers to the allocation of computer resources in time slots(time slices) to several programs simultaneously.


2. What is the symbol for the root directory in a UNIX/Linux filesystem?

	"/".


3. Which symbol is used as a separator in a filepath?

	"/" in linux, "\" in windows.



4. What are the two types of filepaths in a Linux filesystem? How do they differ from each other?
	
	Absolute Path: Path reference is from the root directory.

	Relative Path: Path reference is from the current directory.


5. Which symbol is used to represent the following: home directory, current directory, and parent directory, home directory of a user named user1

	Home directory: "/home/user"
	Current directory: .
	Parent directory: ..
	home directory of a user named user1: "/home"

6. Write a command to do the following:
	a. list all the files ending with .txt
		$ ls *.txt	

	b. count the words and lines in a file
		$ wc -lw filename

	c. find and replace all occurrences of ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ (case insensitive)
		$ sed -i "s/foo/bar/gI" filename

	d. find and replace all occurrences of only ‘Foo’ with ‘bar’ (case sensitive)
		$ sed -i "s/Foo/bar/g" filename

	$ touch \*
	$ rm \*

8. What is the absolute path of the file that has the initial configurations of a Bash shell stored? (include the filename in the filepath as well)
	/home/user/.bashrc

9. What does the environment variable PATH hold?
	The environment PATH variable stores the list of paths of executables on the 	device.	

10. How do you run a program named hello through Linux Terminal?
	$ ./hello

11. Under what circumstances do you get a “command not found” error when you run a
program?

	If the path of the executable(having the name of the command) is not found in the PATH variable then we get the "command not found" error.

12. Explain the file permissions seen in the output of the command ls -l?
	r(4) , w(2) , e(1)

13. Write a command to append the string “Hello CS3010” to an existing file named
strings.out
	$ echo “Hello CS3010” >> strings.out	


14. Write a command to run the program named hello (present in the current directory) to
redirect error messages to a file named hello.err

	$ ./hello 2> hello.err

15. Write a command to run the program named hello (present in the current directory) to
redirect its outputs and error messages to a file named hello.log
	
	$ ./hello &> hello.log
	

16. Write a command to run the program named hello (present in the current directory),
and redirect its output to hello.out, and error messages thrown by the program to a
file named hello.err
	
	$ ./hello > hello.out 2> hello.er

17. Write a command to run the program named hello (present in the current directory),
and send its output as inputs to the program /bin/wc. The final output should be the
count of the number of lines of output printed by the hello

	$ ./hello | /bin/wc -l


18. Write a command to write the list of files in a directory to a file named files.txt.
Example output:
files.txt
============
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
hello
hello.c
Notes.txt

	$ ls > files.txt



19. Write a command to list all the C source files (names with extension .c) in the current directory and all its sub-directories.

	$ find . -name "*.c"

20. Write a command to delete all blank lines in a file (using sed).

	$ sed -i "/^$/d" filename

21. Write a command to count all lines that end with ‘;’ in a file.

	$ grep ";$" hello.txt | wc -l


22. What is the difference between AT&T syntax and Intel syntax when writing x86
assembly?
	
	
23. How many general-purpose registers are supported by x86 (32-bit architecture)? What
are their names?
	8 GPR's.
	EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESP, EBP, EDI, ESI


24. How many general-purpose registers are supported by x86_64 (64-bit architecture)?
What are their names?


25. What does the register %eip hold?
	Program counter

26. What is the register %esp used for?
	Used for storing the address of the current position of stack pointer in the memory.

27. What is the register %esi, and %edi used for?
28. List all the segment registers in x86, and the corresponding segments that each of them point to?


29. What are the three operating modes of a IA 32 PC compatible, x86 processor?

	Real Address Mode
	Protected Mode
	System Management Mode


30. Write the x86_64 (or x64) assembly code to evaluate the expression,
A = B * C / D - E
Assume A is allocated in %rax, B in %rbx, C in %rcx, D in %rdx, and E in %r8.
Note: Refer to the following cheat sheet if required.
https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf

31. What is the difference between linear addresses and segmented addresses in x86
architecture (IA32 PC architecture)?
	
	
 A segment selector is a special pointer that identifies a segment in memory

The 32-bit EFLAGS register contains a group of status flags, a control flag, and a group of system flags.



32. Consider the two csv files, and their contents given below:
Lectures.csv Labs.csv
============ =========
Student1,CS3010,23 Student1,CS3110,93
Student2,CS3010,39 Student2,CS3110,100
Student3,CS3010,12 Student3,CS3110,32
Student1,CS3030,40 Student1,CS3130,85
Student2,CS3030,30 Student2,CS3130,76
Student3,CS3030,40 Student3,CS3130,50
Student1,CS3050,15
Student2,CS3050,25
Student3,CS3050,35
The first column in each of these files contain names of students, the second column
contains the subject, and the third column contains their marks in the corresponding
subjects.
Write a BASH shell script that collates the marks of each student into a single row. The
output file should also have a header indicating the subject code as the column header.
Use the | operator where possible. The script should also use BASH shell functions
(discussed in the tutorial shared on Moodle) where possible. Example output is below:
Name,CS3010,CS3030,CS3050,CS3110,CS3110
Student1,23,40,15,93,85
Student2,39,30,25,100,76
